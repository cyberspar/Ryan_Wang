            <p>In the latest episode of the NOWNESS "Behind the Scenes" series, actors Zhou Xun, Jing Boran, and Zhang Junning give an insight into the 15th FIRST Youth Film Festival and Chanel's "FIRST FRAME" from their own perspectives. They also shared their perspectives on the film. They also talked with several short film directors and shared their "behind-the-scenes" stories.</p>
            <p>In these six different works, we jumped into the hearts of the characters, explored and pursued beauty, let our emotions ebb and flow, and experienced our genuine emotions as human beings; we saw different women exploring the future in the "rivers" of the times and and grew up with them in the long stream of images. Whether in a particular context of the times or confronting the rules of the town, these images start from an everyday perspective, measuring the sorrows and joys of individuals and families at a mundane pace. Life's various thoughts and perceptions are finally integrated into one frame and become one video story.</p>
